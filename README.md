# Hello! 
In this project I developed a [recipeApp](https://gregarious-gelato-39cf0d.netlify.app/) using React as framework and styled with [sass](https://sass-lang.com/).
The app allow you to navigate in several pages showed in a NavBar (recipes and settings links). In the recipe page, we can see the searchs history which can be removed by clicking in the element or added by typing in a placeholder. In addition, in the setting we can handle the theme of the app between several options such as: color, animation speed, fontsize or turn the screen to dark at night time (drak mode).
One feature that I want  to mention is the presence of a clickable *SIGN UP NOW* button that redirect to a register form.
Below, I'm posting one of the screen print of the following app:
